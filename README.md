# Landing-Page-OP

This is a landing page template made with pure HTML and CSS for TheOdinProject.

The layout has been made using flexbox.

- Change the text as you wish
- In order to change/add pictures instead of placeholders, change the img src:

   <div class="image">
          <img class="imgDummy" src="https://dummyimage.com/640x360/fff/aaa" alt="img" />
          
      - the http link is holding place for a dummy image. Replace accordingly and adjust the css attributes.

- In order to change the images in the square boxes / information container, add the following attribute to the css file:

  .image-container {
  background-image: url("")
  }
  
  - replace the space between the "" with the image address.
